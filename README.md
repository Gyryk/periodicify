# Periodic-ify
## A small react app that encodes normal phrases into elements from the periodic table

The app is pretty self-explanatory. You type in all the text you want to change and then if there are valid elements for the words, you will get the encoded text.
### I decided that constant errors of not having the element was too annoying so I am adding made-up stuff that gets used if nothing else is found. <br>
### If you do not want to use the fake elements you do not have to, since they only show up when an error otherwise would've.

> This was my first time making a react app so there might be some inefficiencies with the code. I did my best for my current knowledge.
